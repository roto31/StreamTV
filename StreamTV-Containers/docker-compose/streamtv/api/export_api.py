    - Query channel, schedules, playlists, collections, and media from DB
    - Convert to YAML structure matching import format
    - Return as downloadable file or string
    - Optionally create git commit/PR for version-controlled channel definitions
    
    Use cases:
    - Export modified channels after UI edits
    - Generate YAML templates from API-created resources
    - Sync DB state to YAML source of truth

# TODO: Future enhancements
# - Export to other formats (JSON, TOML)?
# - Git integration (auto-commit, PR creation via GitHub API)
# - Diff view between DB and YAML state
# - Selective export (only changed resources)
# - Import/export presets for common channel types
